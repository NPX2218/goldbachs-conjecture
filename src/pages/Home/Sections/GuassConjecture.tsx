      <h2 className="text-white text-2xl font-bold pb-2">Gauss's Conjecture</h2>
      <p>
        Carl Friedrich Gauss inspected the relationship between prime numbers
        and if there was a quantifiable relationship that could help predict the
        number of prime numbers in relation to the real numbers. For that, he
        made tables consisting of the primes up to 3 million and looked for
        patterns. To graph a relationship, Gauss created a function called the
        Prime Counting Function. For every prime number reached on the x-axis,
        the y-axis was incremented by one. This essentially created a step-like
        function. An example of the function can be seen here:
      </p>
      <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
        {" "}
        <img src={primeCountingFunction} className="p-8" alt="" />
      </div>
      As the function is tested and for larger and larger number values, Gauss
      had realized if <Latex>{"$\\pi(n) = f(x)$"}</Latex> that must mean that{" "}
      <Latex>{"$\\frac{\\pi(n)}{f(x)} = 1$"}</Latex> assuming that{" "}
      <Latex>{"$f(x)$ "}</Latex>
      correctly evaluates to <Latex>{"$\\pi(n)$"}</Latex>. Gauss had noticed
      that a function <Latex>{"$f(x) = \\frac{n}{ln(n)}$"}</Latex> and where{" "}
      <Latex>{"$\\frac{\\pi(n)}{\\frac{n}{ln(n)}} = 1$"}</Latex> had fit his
      model as <Latex>{"$N \\rightarrow \\infin$"}</Latex>. Or more simply:
      <span className="p-8 w-full flex items-center justify-center">
        <Latex>
          {
            "$\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow \\infin} \\frac{\\pi(n)}{\\frac{n}{ln(n)}} = 1$"
          }
        </Latex>
      </span>
      This allowed him to postulate that the prime counting function could be
      defined as:
      <span className="w-full flex items-center justify-center p-8">
        {" "}
        <Latex>{"$\\displaystyle \\pi(n) \\sim  \\frac{n}{ln(n)}$"}</Latex>
      </span>
      Gauss's conjecture was later proved to be true mathematically true
      independently by both Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vall√©e
      Poussin. Both mathematicians used the Riemann zeta function to prove the
      prime number theorem.
