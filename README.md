# 🔢 Number Theory Explorer & Visualizer focused on Goldbach's Conjecture

An interactive web-based learning tool built with React and Desmos that explores deep, elegant problems in number theory, from Goldbach’s Conjecture to the Riemann Hypothesis. This project connects abstract mathematics with visual methods to make complex ideas approachable for all.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧮 Prime Number Theorem Visualized – Compare π(x), li(x), and x/ln(x) with live annotated graphs showing how primes "thin out" as x increases.
- 📉 Riemann Hypothesis Walkthrough – Explore ζ(s), the critical line, and what zero distributions suggest about prime density.
- 🧠 Hardy–Littlewood Circle Method – Understand additive number theory through prime pair representations and visual density estimates.
- 🔵 Interactive Desmos Visualizer – Plot modular structures and prime sums inside a dynamic circle to reveal surprising patterns.
- ✍️ Handwritten Derivations & LaTeX Proofs – Follow clean, original explanations of key theorems that blend logic and intuition.
